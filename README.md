# react-simple-carousel

A light lazy loading carousel


## The Plan
The plan is to create a simple horizontal carousel, targeted for real world use in a reactjs app. The project is not going to implement crazy effects that are rarely going to be used, but instead is going to focus on simple and effiecient dom updates.

The first version is probably only going to be a slider without loop


## Next
- Remove the unnecessary props
- Write tests for the remaing code
- Tidy up the code and Flow definitions
- Implement loop mode
- Implement an easy wasy to add more transitions through composition
- Implement a customisable pagination
- Make a ReasonML version
